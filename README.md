This is my final project on ALX for backend specialization. This is a website designed where Admins can post jobs. Users can then access all available jobs after they have created an account.

Technologies used:
I used express.js framework for the backend.
Node.js environment 
I used mongodb for the database. It serves as a tool where jobs can be created, saved, update, deleted and uploaded

more information about this project will be updated soon.
